# 📈 End-to-End Sales & Transaction Analytics

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project integrates multi-source data (Web Traffic & Multi-year Sales) to identify performance bottlenecks in the retail conversion funnel. It showcases the transition from raw data cleaning in Python to high-level strategic reporting in Power BI.

## 📊 Business Logic Implemented
1. **Sales Consolidation:** Unified 3 years of fragmented sales logs (2015-2017) using Python Pandas.
2. **Payment Funnel Analysis:** Analyzed the "Success Rate" of transactions from the UPI PIN page to final transfer completion.
3. **Store Benchmarking:** Developed SQL Window Functions to rank stores dynamically by quarterly revenue.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Excel:** Initial data exploration and metadata mapping.
- **SQL:** Complex joins and CTEs for performance ranking.
- **Python:** Automated data cleaning and conversion math.
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards for executive-level review.
